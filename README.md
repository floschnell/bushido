# bushido

This is a webapp to use your Bushido home trainer with a GPX recording or a planned tour.

In a nutshell, features are:
- loading and smoothing of a GPX route
- connecting to your Bushido trainer (via WebUSB)
- collecting metrics like power, speed, cadence and heart rate
- adjusting slope depending on your current position on the GPX route
- rendering your position into a 3d environment via Cesium
- exporting your stats as a GPX file, so you can share your efforts on Strava or elsewhere
